Use `ucsealnew.pdf` (if you use `pdflatex`) or `ucsealnew.eps` (if you use conventional LaTeX).

The file `example.md` is an example of how to write the letter using Pandoc (or RStudio)-flavor markdown:

```bash
pandoc example.md -o example.pdf
```

The file `test.tex` is an example of how to write a letter in LaTeX:

```bash
pdflatex test.tex
```
